            <h2>What's Math More?</h2>
            <p>Math More is a fun website to train you to properly solve addition and subtraction problems!</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <button class="accordion">What do the letters stand for?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> The letters indicate each level's mode. For instance, the E 
                    stands for "easy", the M stands for "medium", and the H stands 
                    for "hard". The last letter S stands for "story mode". For 
                    these three levels, you'll go through a total of ten questions. 
                    At the very end, you'll receive a score and a list of problems 
                    you got wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What's the difference between the difficulty levels?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Easy mode uses addition and subtraction problems with just one 
                    digit! Medium uses two digit numbers, and hard mode uses three 
                    digit numbers.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">I changed my answer to a wrong answer but still got the problem correct. Why?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> At Math More, we celebrate the small successes! If you got the 
                    answer right at a point in time but changed it later, we'll still 
                    mark it as correct! However, you'll see your wrong answer show up 
                    in the final list of wrong answers so that you can learn from your 
                    mistakes.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">I got a perfect score, but there are problems listed under "Problems You Got Wrong". Why?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Math More provides thorough feedback for you to learn from your 
                    mistakes. As a result, your score will take into account your 
                    final answers. However, if you hesitated on a problem or went 
                    back and changed your answer for it, Math More will list it so 
                    that you're aware that you're not very confident on that problem.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What's story mode?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Story mode is a way to practice basic addition and subtraction 
                    problems in a situation context. As a result, there's a story 
                    problem that you'll solve! For this mode, you'll be able to 
                    immediately see if your answers is correct or not. You'll still 
                    get only ten problems.</p>
