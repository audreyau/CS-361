- Your partner MUST use your service for their individual project.
- Each person MUST write ALL their own code.
- To count as a service, requesting/exchanging data between projects MUST happen WITHOUT directly calling each other's code and must be called programmatically (without requiring user interaction).

- Your code MUST be free of unjustified code smells.
